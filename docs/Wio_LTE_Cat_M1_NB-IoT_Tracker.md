Seeed’s Wio LTE CAT M1/NB-IoT is designed
for Low-Power Wide-Area Network
(LPWAN) with CAT M1(eMTC) and NB-IoT
combo module. Besides, It has an ARM
Cortex-M4 MCU and GNSS module.

It’s Arduino and Espruino(JavaScript)
compatible development board helps to
track nearly any moving thing on the planet
and then upload that data wirelessly. By
integrating Grove connector, the Wio LTE
CAT M1/NB-IoT allows for flexible
communication solutions with Grove
systems.


Wio LTE CAT M1/NB-IoT is well suited for
outdoor projects where the device can
connect to the satellite navigation system
and provide a real-time location of the item
it is attached to.


Wio LTE CAT M1/NB-IoT support
Espruino(JavaScript) engine so that anyone
can build IoT project rapidly, especially
while you can use lot of resource of
JavaScript community.
